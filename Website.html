            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Lifting the words off the page and giving your imagination a voice. In every project, 
                Jacob brings care and thoughtfulness to the roles he plays and his own brand of imaginative charm behind 
                the scenes. With his natural British accent every project from narration to commercials to whatever you need is delivered with sincerity.
                
                <br><br>
                Enhance your work with a performance that enthralls, captivates and connects.
                As a versatile actor and emotive human being, Jacob brings depth to your characters of all shapes and sizes. Trustworthy narrators, 
                innocent heroes, and fantastical villains.
                <br><br>
                For Jacob, your script is another opportunity to tell a story, whether it be of bold knights, a far flung future, or the friend next door 
                telling you how to chop a carrot. As lover of storytelling Jacob is well versed in its many forms: Animation, video games, fantasy 
                and tabletop RPGs all made more real with his voice behind them.

                        <p>After weeks of annoying your friend you have finally made him cave and include you in his hobby. He’s agreed to teach you as long as you follow his rules strictly and do exactly what he says. So as he said you went to the hardware store to pick up supplies. It was a really long list and you think you got everything though you can be forgetful sometimes. It can’t be that important because he's always too particular about his instructions. Besides, what could go wrong? Necromancy can’t be that hard… Right?</p>

                        <p>A few weeks have passed since Juian lost his job. It’s undeniably hit him hard and it’s difficult for you to see someone you care about like this. You’ve been picking up extra shifts to compensate which also leaves you out of the apartment when you really want to be taking care of Julian. Everyday he’s online for hours applying for jobs but unfortunately he hasn’t gotten an interview yet. No time to dwell on that now. It’s time for work and recently you have been making friends with the rest of your coworkers. You're sharing a shift today with 2 other servers Sydney and Ryan. Even at work your mind is always elsewhere. You just want everything to go back to how it was. But frankly, that’s probably not possible. Ever since that night when Julian broke down you haven’t quite been able to see him the same. You’re not sure why. </p>

                        <p>The disappearances of individuals experiencing heartbreak have started to become more frequent, with rumors around town calling it the work of a monster who takes the shape of their loved ones to steal their hearts. Having recently lost your long-time crush to someone else, you're not too surprised when someone claiming to be your crush invites you to the outskirts of town to discuss some relationship issues they've been having. But finding someone else to share your heart with might not be such a bad idea.</p>

                        <p>Things have been good. After recovering from your illness things have settled down. Frankly, while things have been busy you enjoy the routine. You’ve made some friends at work and things could certainly be substantially worse. One morning you have just finished getting ready for work. You have a full shift today and need to be in early. As you are getting ready to leave you notice Julian’s work clothes still left out and his work bag still by the door. Strange he should be heading out soon himself. Your ears perk up hearing from his room the tail end of a conversation. From the sounds of it something is wrong. At a guess it sounds like his boss is complaining about him. But that wouldn’t happen. Julian is a good person… Isn’t he?</p>

A few months ago he discovered you, and while you’ve been playing friendly in order to stay safe, he’s annoyed you to no end. No matter what you’re doing, that human always seems to force his help on you. And so, you’ve decided to avoid interactions whenever possible. And for the past few weeks, it’s been working fantastic! He’s never stopped you for a conversation or tried to help you since. Tonight you left your safe haven for another food run, but the human is asleep on the kitchen table. So you need to move extra quietly in order to not wake him up…</p>

One morning, you wake up and start getting ready for your shift. The problem is, you don’t feel good. Your nose is clogged, your throat is hoarse and your head hurts. It’s hot and cold and your walk is a little wobbly. Regardless, you need to get to work. You hop in the shower and decide to skip breakfast as your stomach is feeling pretty rough. It’s not that bad you can just power through the rest of the day, right?</p>

                        <hr/>
                        <p>On your way back from the shops you see, nestled behind a set of bins, a small adorable little cat. The poor baby was shaking and so seeing no collar you wrapped them up and brought them home. Immediately the little cat bonded to you becoming incredibly affectionate especially after a tin of tuna. A quick bath later and the new addition to your flat was home and cozy. After a day of adorable bonding you find yourself half asleep in your room before you remember. You were supposed to do the dishes. Poop your perpetually annoyed roommate is going to be even more peeved when he finds you forgot to do the dishes. Oh no. You forgot about your roommate. He could definitely be a cat person… Right?</p>

                        <p>The interview has been arranged for today and you are very nervous. Chester had called in to his friend Michael, owner of the hybrid cafe Sit sip stay, and recommended you for the server job he had available. This is the only lead you have so far in regards to work. Julian has been putting extra hours at his work and it’s definitely taken its toll. He wasn’t particularly relaxed at the best of times but the last day or so he has been very stressed regarding your employment. Though he does his best not to show it. You have to get this job, you can’t stand idly by as the person who saved you is now slowly succumbing to his awful job. You’ve done all the preparations you can and now standing just outside the cafe, Julian turns with some final words of encouragement. You’ve got this… Right?</p>

So you drink, and drink, and drink. Then you can’t remember much after that. Now you’ve woken up on someone else's sofa, in someone else's home. Overhearing someone humming from the kitchen you nervously get up to see what’s going on. Whoever it is can’t be that bad, right?...</p>

                        <p>Your village lies beneath the shadow of the Splintercrest mountains, and a cruel tyrant overlord. A dragon, said to be older than fire itself has made its lair within the mountains and has called for the surrounding villages to offer tribute to ensure the village remains safe from his wrath. This agreement has plagued the villages of the valley for centuries and this season panic struck the village as not enough funds were salvaged for the tribute. You had suggested the village elders sell their old heirlooms or dip into the wealth of their forefathers. This was not well received by the elders and it was decided that you were to deliver what little coinage you had to offer, and yourself in place of the missing payment for the dragon to devour or enslave. Each step you trod brought you closer to your doom and as much as you wished to flee - doing so would only bring the full wrath of the dragon down upon the people you care about. As the sun sank out of sight, you reached the dragon’s cave. This is the end… Isn’t it?</p>

This morning the skies opened up and a harsh storm began to blow over the West road upon which you are travelling. Still you rode on into the night. Now you and your horse are cold and exhausted. In the dead of night your horse limply trots down the muddy road and you pray for some form of shelter soon before the nighttime cold truly sets in. The journey has been long and hard. You need rest. Then up the road you see to the side a wooden building with lights lit up. Lanterns dot the outside illuminating a sign above the door reading “The Lit Lamp”. It’s an inn. You ride your horse near the covered barn area and pray someone is inside and would let you stay the evening. As you secure your mount you begin to hear the soft singing from someone inside and the smell of stew wafts over you. Could this place really have everything you need tonight?</p>

It’s strange because you’ve lived here a while and haven’t had any issues like this before. Nevertheless, you can’t live like this anymore and you just so happened to find a flyer for the “Phantom Fixers” a group of professional ghost exterminators. You gave them a quick call and explained the situation and they agreed to send a professional “Phantom Fixer” to your home.

                        <p>For the first time in a long while you were able to have a good night’s rest. Yesterday, what felt like an age of being homeless and stray on the streets, a kind stranger approached you and offered to help. Julian (as he would later introduce himself) took you to get some food and showed compassion you hadn’t seen in a long time. He made you feel like a real person again after so long. Whilst discussing what to do in the long term you managed to convince him to let you stay at his place for the evening. As he said it wasn’t the nicest apartment but it was leagues better than being out in the rain. After a hot shower and some gifted old clothes you went to bed, only to be awoken by the thunder outside. Scared and unable to sleep you went to the tiny living room and crawled under the blanket with Julian. Protesting at first, he eventually let you sleep on the sofa with him so you could feel safe. In the morning, he treated you to some breakfast and you two began your day shopping for some clothes for you. During this time Julian was able to make an appointment with his stylist friend who should be able to help you out with some of the matting in your fur. Though, something seems to be troubling Julian. He’s quite reserved and there’s an energy to him you can’t help but feel a little sympathy for. What is the story with your new friend, and can his old friend be as trustworthy as he says? Someone so kind couldn’t be a bad person… Could he?</p>

As a neko on the streets you’ve been scared that people might try to haul you off to some animal shelter to be adopted by people wanting a new pet. But past experiences have you trying your hardest to avoid that. That’s not the life you want to live. So far things have been bad, but at the very least the weather has been okay. A warm dry summer left sleeping rough easier than you would have thought. Unfortunately, your luck seems to have run out on that front. Earlier today the clouds opened up a terrible storm and the temperature has been dropping. Now in the evening you find yourself huddled under some bins trying to keep as dry and warm as you can. You’re hungry, cold, wet, and scared. As the storm rages on into the night, you hear the sound of footsteps coming down the streets well as some particularly unhappy grumbles. Your tail catches on some loose rubbish knocking them to the ground. He turns, “Hello… Is anyone there?” he calls out. You decide it’s best to hide, he can’t be good news… Can he?</p>

Despite all of your attempts to convince him that he actually did love you (he does) he still gave you over to your creepy stalker Jason. Upon arrival you were led to a lavish room where Jason confessed his undying love to you. The problem is your heart belongs to another and surely your one true love would be returning to rescue you. But, how would he find you? Obviously the best way to get your true love to you would be to get him kidnapped as well. You began to enact your master plan, each time Jason spoke to you, you constantly reminded him that your sweetheart would soon arrive to rescue you. It clearly took its toll on Jason as you were moved to a more secure (less pleasant) cell under the house and he began to grow more and more agitated. He’s about to snap. Just now, you hear someone coming down the corridor to your cell. It must be your darling who comes to rescue you… Right?</p>

Recently you have been overjoyed, as you noticed that Lewis has been following you as well. He must be preparing to make his move. You’ve been recording his stalking attempts to add to your collection of pictures and video. He’s not very good at it, but he’s just so cute when he tries. One day when walking home at night you hear his unmistakable footsteps and feel a needle sink into your neck. Before everything goes dark you think to yourself, it was finally time for you two to begin your life together… Right?</p>

Asking around for odd jobs to scrounge together enough coppers for a decent meal you are directed to the town mayor. He wasn’t a particularly pleasant man (politely putting it) however, he mentioned that recently a practitioner of dark magics had trespassed into a ruined elven crypt a few hours away from town. A Necromancer. After dropping a rather hefty sack of coins onto the table, he requested that you delve into the tomb and “deal with him and whatever foul creatures may lurk within the tomb”. You were uncertain, but that money would keep you fed and housed for weeks. Supplies were gathered with the eager support of the townsfolk who had grown fearful of the possible threat of dark magics, then you set off for the tomb. When you arrived, you delved into the tomb meeting surprisingly little resistance. That is until you stumble across an antechamber with the sounds of a muttering individual. It must be the necromancer. You begin to sneak in to end this ordeal with one swift blow to the back of the head. He looks gaunt, pale and tired. That money was as good as yours… Right?</p>

                        <hr/>
                        <p>A couple of months ago your life changed forever. A chance encounter or an event weaved by the hands of fate has now left you with magical powers and a responsibility to protect the world from the evil forces that rally against it. Despite the odds, you have been able to keep things under control. Your new life as a magical defender has now left you more tired than before but it hasn’t encroached on your personal life too much. Everything is fine, or at least almost everything. With the responsibilities of a hero and your own life, your relationships have suffered. Specifically, your relationship with your best friend who it feels like you haven’t seen in ages. After much deliberation you had decided to share your secret with them just so you wouldn’t have to keep lying to them. Finally you had found the time to hang out, everything was planned and the day came. Unfortunately, luck conspired against you and your best friend was put in danger 3 times meaning you had to save them, ruining your hangout. Defeated, you headed home. Maybe you were wrong about telling him. This life is dangerous and you don’t want to see him hurt. He’s already a little dim and careless at the best of times. Your train of exhausted worry is broken by a text. From him. He wants to come over. Feeling bad for missing the hangout, you agree to let him come over. Though there is a thought gnawing at the back of your mind. Could he have figured out your secret?</p>

                        <hr/>
                        <p>In order to negotiate a new trade treaty between your home country and the nation of Derevel, the king has decided it best to bring his family and guard to treat with the leaders of this rival nation. You were one of the few chosen knights to accompany the king and his cohort and to guard them with your life. Upon arrival the company was assigned a large manor house in which to live and conduct negotiations.Fortunately, things have been going well. Unfortunately, the guests to this foreign land include the youngest prince of the realm. You haven’t interacted with him much, even though you have spoken to his many other siblings frequently. From hearing gossip within the guard house, however, you hear that he is a spoiled brat who is rather unpleasant to be around and suffers from a nasty rebellious streak. Many a day you have seen a knight outright reject their duty to keep him safe and request transfer to another role within the king's guard. This morning, you received direct orders from his majesty that you are to be the prince’s new guard and to stay by his side at all times (as well as a few other stranger stipulations). Regardless of your own feelings, you have your duty. He can’t be that bad right?</p>

                        <p>It was meant to be a happy day. A Wedding between a happy couple, a fun party with the allegiance of good, and an evening with your favourite boss. But the day just went from bad to worse, awkward conversation turned to assault by the boss’ nemesis Captain Cricket. One bloody nose and a heart to heart later, you both headed out of the bathroom to find your worst fears have come true. One of the most dangerous individuals on the planet has invaded the reception and you arrive with your boss to see all of the heroes incapacitated. Worst of all, the perpetrator is the man who you rejected, and threatened you in return. Elwood Rowe has come to fulfil his promise.</p>

                        <p>It's been a busy few weeks but, after much preparation, the wedding of Melinda and Gigantor has finally arrived. Your boss has been busy helping planning the wedding so less time has been devoted to his latest evil scheme (the apathy virus). That's not what you're worried about though, your encounter with the notorious supervillain Elwood Rowe has left you shaken to say the least. As well as with a few uncomfortable doubts about your current career choices. But that's not a today problem. Today your job is to make sure the boss doesn't do anything too stupid, especially when surrounded by heroes. With all these thoughts running through your mind you realise you're a little late getting ready. Hopefully that's the worst thing that happens today… Right?</p>

                        <p>When you asked about the burned down building on the outskirts of the village your curiosity peaked. Several months ago the house burned down killing the owner of the home and her close friend. The village folk didn’t seem too happy to talk about it as the area had an unnatural air to it and most avoided it completely. As a new (self titled) occult investigator you decide to do the village a service and investigate. Scouring the rubble you found what looked like a passage leading downwards, the remains of a staircase to the cellar seemingly unexplored after the fire. Kicking up a cloud of dust and ash you head down finding  a small doorway and to your disbelief, sat upon a small chunk of timber, a young man surrounded by the ruins. A chill runs down your spine as what appeared at first to be pale white skin is actually the translucent apparition of some spirit. Though from the looks of it he hasn’t noticed you yet. He can’t be that dangerous… Right?</p>

Progress on what is now under the code name of “the apathy virus” has continued and has been yielding promising results. In fact, you have been struggling a little to keep up with him and during a late-night shift analyzing data samples you may have fallen asleep at your computer. Early in the morning you awake to him softly humming a song in the break room.  He is busy tidying up, beaming a grin across his face. The sun is shining, the birds are singing. Nothing could possibly go wrong today. Right? </p>
